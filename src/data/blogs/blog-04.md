To establish your home as a sanctuary, somewhere far from the bustle of the city in the heart of nature, is an unattainable dream for all but a lucky few. Arguably, anyone fortunate enough to reside in one residence on the Southside of Hong Kong Island could tick off that particular aspiration.

Ideally suited to the needs of a young family of four or so, it is a home in perfect harmony with the green hills and mountains that surround it. Conceived and designed by Andy Wan, the founder of Pure AW’s Designers, an award-winning Wan Chai based design consultancy, his work focused on a fundamental reimagining of an existing structure and its tactical reengineering to meet the needs and values of its new owners.

The reinvented residence now majors on clear open spaces, as well as wide apertures that provide a sense of immense roominess, an attribute accentuated by the ample natural light that permeates throughout. Overall, the interior has been sensitively configured to resemble the external natural landscape, complete with colours and textures that synergistically deliver a blend of the indoors and the outdoors. Throughout, such timeless materials as stone, timber and plaster adorn the walls and ceilings, while the oak flooring is redolent of eternal freshness. This is further counterpointed by the walnut furniture, a soft contrast with the light grey, white and sandy tone of much of the interior space.

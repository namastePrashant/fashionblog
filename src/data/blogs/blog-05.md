More than a facial, less than a surgery: somewhere between the slow progress of retinols and the flick of a scalpel lies the fast-growing industry of tweakments. After the vanities of a world in lockdown, where we spent the better part of two years staring at our reflections in the narcissistic pool of Zoom, came the urge for a ‘fresh face’ that pops rather than drops on social media. From Baby Botox to laser facials, non-invasive aesthetic procedures that deliver natural results are exploding in popularity.

Cosmetic enhancements are no longer a closed-door skincare secret, or in a price bracket reserved for the rich and famous. Procedures that don’t involve being cut open, a general anaesthesia or even hibernating from the world for two weeks are viewed as a stepping stone between the 12-step skincare ritual, which isn’t quite hitting the spot, and a full-blown surgical intervention. Think targeted, futuristic facial with instant results rather than an elaborate eye or face lift.

Time to Tweak?
Tweakments are not designed to change your appearance, get Kylie Jenner’s lips or Bella Hadid’s cheekbones, but to accentuate what you’ve got. They are about lifting, tightening and looking refreshed – not plastic or fake – but beaming with the zen of a post-holiday glow.
The question, ‘Who is your doctor?’ used to be the biggest signifier of good ‘work’ done. As our appetite for non-aesthetic procedures increases – a gentle nip and tuck, a vitamin injectable, a boost of hyaluronic acid to plump things up – remarks like, ‘Are you back from a spa break?’ or ‘You look well rested,’ validate the success of a facial tweak.

Gone are the days of clunky old machines in chilly clinics or over-lit salons. Beauty formulas are now gentler, doctors and aestheticians are more experienced, and with the rise of Instagram influencers there’s no stigma to fat freezing, a lunchtime jab of Botox or getting your pores cosmetically smoothened. Treatments are mostly painless and results swift and targeted, going far beyond the power of skincare alone. So, if you are wondering just how those tiny rivulets across the landscape of a colleague’s face magically disappeared over the weekend, read on….
